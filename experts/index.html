              <h5 class="title title--tiny title--bold title--lower">Where do you live and what inspires you most about where you live?</h5>
              <p>I live in Cape Town, South Africa. It’s really hard to put into words what inspires me about Cape Town. It could be that the whole city is built around one of the most incredible mountains in the world, it could be the beautiful beaches, the rich cultures, the people and the food.</p>
              <p>But my favourite reason is the quality of life, there is no limit to the activities you can do – hiking, mountain biking, surfing, kite surfing and trail running… The list could go on forever.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="interview__question">
              <h5 class="title title--tiny title--bold title--lower">What is your favourite spot in South Africa?</h5>
              <p>As a place to live, it would definitely be Cape Town – it’s the perfect mix of buzz and nature. For a holiday it would have to be Blyde River Canyon and Kruger National park. Blyde River Canyon is for me in the top five most beautiful places I’ve ever seen throughout the world. Then Kruger, which is an hour’s drive away from Blyde, is just incredible – watching the stars while hearing lions roar is a feeling you can’t forget.</p>

              <h5 class="title title--tiny title--bold title--lower">Best hidden gem in South Africa?</h5>
              <p>Graaff Reinet- Specifically the Valley of Desolation. Graaff Reinet is a little town in the middle of nowhere – the old buildings and feel of the town is so perfectly preserved, it really feels like you step back in time. The Valley Of Desolation is a national Park in Graaff Reinet, which has the most amazing valley with rock formations.</p>

            <div class="interview__question">
              <h5 class="title title--tiny title--bold title--lower">What makes you feel proud to be South African?</h5>
              <p>South Africa is a young democracy, I love the different cultures, and I love being part of building a rainbow nation.</p>

              <h5 class="title title--tiny title--bold title--lower">What's your favourite place to photograph in all of South Africa?</h5>
              <p>Such a hard question, I’d have to say Cape Town, Garden Route, Limpopo and Drakensberg, each location is so unique.</p>

              <h5 class="title title--tiny title--bold title--lower">Do you approach shooting South Africa any differently from normal?</h5>
              <p>I suppose every location you need to approach a little differently while maintaining a consistent style. However South Africa is so diverse; there is everything from mountains, oceans, deserts, jungles and safaris. Each location needs a little research. Lastly just be aware of where you shoot, most places are safe to shoot pictures, but I wouldn’t go walking around at night with a bunch of camera gear on my own.</p>

            <div class="interview__question">
              <h5 class="title title--tiny title--bold title--lower">Any tips for budding photographers in SA?</h5>
              <p>Spend time exploring, and researching – a lot of the best images are taken are off the normal path. Photography is a skill and you can only get better if you put in the hours, shooting, learning and editing.</p>

              <h5 class="title title--tiny title--bold title--lower"> Where do you live and what inspires you most about where you live?</h5>
              <p>I live in Durban, South Africa – living in South Africa you get to experience such diverse and unique cultures widely spread across our country. Landscapes vary from our beautiful mountains in Cape Town, incredible beaches in Durban to our bustling city life in Johannesburg. Its one of few places in the world where you can experience so much diversity in a single city and I love that about South Africa!</p>

              <h5 class="title title--tiny title--bold title--lower">Best hidden gem in South Africa?</h5>
              <p>I'm still finding more and more hidden beauties in South Africa but so far my favourite has to be a hidden beach in Durban called Thompson bay, which is found by walking through a man sized hole in the rocks, I've spent many sunrises soaking in it's unpopulated beauty. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="interview__question">
              <h5 class="title title--tiny title--bold title--lower">Where's your favourite place to eat?</h5>
              <p>In Durban there is a small container ship that has been recreated into a chicken shop called "Afros" where you can find durbans most popular chicken, and personally, my absolute favourite! If you're ever in Durban it's a must, I guarantee you'll fall in love.</p>

              <p>I would have to say Cape Town, besides its incredible landscapes and surroundings – the culture and social vibe is amazing. It's creative community is probably the most advanced in South Africa so it's a great place to collaborate with fellow creatives. My favourite place would be in the mountains! Either hiking to the top of Lion’s Head or enjoying a cable cart to the top of Table Mountain.</p>
              <p>In Durban it would be its incredible beach life with its warm waters and great waves! If it's sunny, I can't imagine a better place to spend the day!</p>
              <p>In Johannesburg  the city buzz and social vibe is amazing. It's the business hub of the country and my favourite place would be sitting on top of one of the city's buildings enjoying the sunset over the cityscape!</p>

              <p>I'd head to the V&amp;A waterfront in Cape Town where you can experience a lot of South Africa's culture in one place, from the local food to some local shops – including all the big brands you'd find overseas. It's a great shopping mall surrounded by the beautiful landscapes of Cape Town including boat rides to Robbin island and surrounding bays!</p>

I'm very grateful and blessed to have realized my childhood dream and I'm excited to see what the future holds and to achieve my next dream!</p>

              <h5 class="title title--tiny title--bold title--lower">How has your vlogging aided your travels?</h5>
              <p>I believe it provides me with a healthy distraction from the pressures of traveling for swim meets – when it's traveling for vacation or leisure it's great because it pushes me to see more of the location and at the same time captures the experience and memories for me to visit at a later stage. Vlogging and photography being huge passions of mine it's incredibly exciting to document new places on these platforms and is one of the things that put the biggest smiles on my face.</p>

              <ol>
                <li>The Drakensberg Mountains – When you are in the Drakensberg there is such a beautiful serenity that surrounds you; it is a place of majesty and peace, a place to contemplate and re-centre. The hikes are amazing and the views are incredible!</li>
                <li>Sunset over Chapman's Peak in the Cape. It is picture-perfect, like you have for a fleeting moment found a peak-hole into heaven and caught a glimpse of earth in it's perfect state.</li>

            <div class="interview__question">
              <h5 class="title title--tiny title--bold title--lower">Where do you go to have fun with friends?</h5>
              <p>I love Durban's beaches, so we spend a lot of time there when the weather is good, and an Afro's chicken is always a win on the Beachfront. We also enjoy going for a drive through the Natal Midlands and exploring the little treasures along the Midlands meander.</p>

              <h5 class="title title--tiny title--bold title--lower">How is being a jeweller in South Africa different to, say, London?</h5>
              <p>I think the studio jewellery movement in South Africa is still a few steps behind first-world countries like London. The public are still quite conservative in their response to artistic jewellery here, and so we have to find the fine line of integrating our art/creativity into a fairly conservative, commercial dimension.</p>
              <p>Having said that, there has been a considerable progression in the last 10 years in South African Contemporary Jewellery and it is exciting to be a part of the movement. South African jewellers are exposed to the rich cultural heritage of this country  and as a result, have a unique style and approach to what we make that you might not find elsewhere.</p>

            <div class="interview__question">
              <h5 class="title title--tiny title--bold title--lower">What inspires you?</h5>
              <p>Life!</p>
              <p>People are like sponges, continuously absorbing as life happens and I think creativity is the expression of these things and a way of letting them out. I find myself inspired by different things all the time, be it cracks in the pavement, nature, emotions, stories and verses or objects. Fortunately Durban is a place rich in all these things and there is so much to be inspired by as a designer living here.</p>

              <h5 class="title title--tiny title--bold title--lower">Where would you go to get the best experience of South African fashion and design?</h5>
              <p>There are a lot of creative 'hubs' spotted around South Africa such as Station Drive (Durban) The Woodstock Exchange (Cape Town) and Arts on Main in the Maboneng Precinct (Johannesburg) where artists and designers have created studio spaces and retail spaces that encapsulate their life, work and style.  I would say that the best way to experience South African fashion, art, and design is to to see where it comes from and experience the 'life' in these hubs – see the studio spaces that the creatives and makers work in, talk to them and understand what they make and how they make it. South African creatives have a grounded openness and they love to share what they do with people.</p>

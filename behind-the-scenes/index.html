        <h5 class="title title--tiny title--bold title--lower">Safari is the most iconic SA experience – what made it special for you?</h5>
        <p>Before heading to South Africa and knowing we were going on safari, I was most excited to be able to see a lion in its natural surroundings. However getting there and being so close to a herd of elephants absolutely made it for me, especially seeing the baby elephants running around and cooling down in the puddles of mud. There were also two elders that got into a bit of a scuffle which was great to watch. </p>
        <p>This along with watching a Cape Buffalo fight a pride of lions, then the lions later failing to catch an antelope due to the overzealous cubs, was the most incredible experience. All that was missing was the voice of David Attenborough commentating!</p>

        <h5 class="title title--tiny title--bold title--lower">Tell us about the NeighbourGoods Market in Johannesburg ...</h5>
        <p>The bustling NeighbourGoods Market seemed more of an event rather than your average market. There is so much food to choose from so it took a while for me to decide. I had quite a few samples to start off with and washing it all down with a refreshing lemon and mint drink. I eventually opted for an Asian fish dish from the stall of singing chefs. I was quite saddened that the giant Paella weren't quite ready whilst we were there.</p>
        <p>I got talking to a guy who was selling his handmade jewellery and artwork (<a href ="https://www.facebook.com/Nutcasestudy/">Nutcase Acts</a>). All of his metal based work were made up of nuts, bolts and zips, to create lovely bracelets, necklaces and even a headpiece. This stall was on the same floor as customised t-shirts, homemade children’s clothing and African printed fabrics made into more commercial attire.</p>

        <h5 class="title title--tiny title--bold title--lower">Bo-Kaap looks super cool...</h5>
        <p>There is no way you can walk around Bo-Kaap without a smile on your face. The bright vibrant coloured houses, instantly make you feel happy. The locals are more than happy to chat to you about the area and its Cape Malay culture. If you're there around 12pm, you get to hear the noon gun fire.</p>
        <h5 class="title title--tiny title--bold title--lower">Tell us about Gamidah, and your experience cooking with her…</h5>
        <p>Gamidah was hilarious and so welcoming. She would play up to the camera a bit and had us laughing throughout. At the time we were there she mentioned that she keeps one of the rooms in her house available to a lodger. Her current lodger, whilst we were there, had been to a cooking class with Gamidah a few years back and keeps coming back to Cape Town to stay with Gamidah whilst she holidays in Cape Town. </p>
        <p>If I do make it back to Cape Town, I'd definitely be going to visit Gamidah again, even just for a chat. And the food we cooked was delicious. I've attempted it again at home!</p>

        <h5 class="title title--tiny title--bold title--lower">You went to Kloof Street, what stood out for you there?</h5>
        <p>There is a great atmosphere around Kloof Street. All of the bars, cafe's and restaurants were busy. If you venture down one of the streets off the main street, there are a lot of art shops and museums. There is so much that Kloof Street has to offer it's difficult to decide where to settle. You’re bound, however, to end up somewhere delightful.</p>
        <h5 class="title title--tiny title--bold title--lower">Table Mountain seems the perfect spot for stunning views and sunset picnics…</h5>
        <p>Everyone is there for the same thing, so there is a lovely atmosphere. There is a slight anticipation which adds to this. As it begins, the sky changes colour rather dramatically, and continues to do so until the sun has set. It was nice to see quite a few couples up there as it's rather a romantic setting. Plus you’re guaranteed to get a good picture!</p>

        <h5 class="title title--tiny title--bold title--lower">What would you recommend the most out of all the things you experienced?</h5>
        <p>Exploring, seeing and doing as much as you can. There is something for everyone but if you are able to, go on safari.</p>
        <h5 class="title title--tiny title--bold title--lower">Leaving the city, you headed to Cape Winelands, a great destination for sure. What were your highlights?</h5>
        <p>Seeing all the greenery that you’re surrounded by – the opposite to lands in Kruger. Driving up to the winelands, we went past a huge pirate ship in the middle of a field. This turns out to be a film set which I think you're able to visit. But when we got to the <a href="http://www.delaire.co.za/">Graaf Delaire Estate</a>, there were so many different flowers amongst the bronze sculptures on the estate. The vineyards seem to go on forever. It was also great to see the painting of the 'Chinese Girl' which I've seen so many reproductions of throughout the years.</p>

        <h5 class="title title--tiny title--bold title--lower">Which wines did you try and what food accompanied them?</h5>
        <p>Starting with the light Cabernet Franc Rose, we went on to the Sauvignon Blanc, White Reserve then the Botmaskopf – finishing with the Cabernet Reserve. We chose the charcuterie and cheese board accompanied with chutneys and cornichons to go with our wines. </p>
        <p>Though it was difficult to choose from, I think the Bokmaskopf was my favourite.</p>
        <h5 class="title title--tiny title--bold title--lower">Now for the uncommon animals. Those ducks, and those penguins! What was that like?</h5>
        <p>The duck parade was so fun. There was a school trip there at the same time which made it more fun as the kids were so excited by it. Learning about the different breeds they have on the estate was interesting. And I loved being able to feed the rabbits leaves from the vegetable patch and some of the ducklings all in the most beautiful setting.</p>
        <p>Boulders Beach felt a bit surreal. Casually hanging out with a bunch penguins, on a beach! I really wanted to pet them but was scared they might peck with with their beaks. I'm sure they wouldn't have...</p>

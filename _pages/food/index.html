        <h3 class="title title--lower title--medium title--spacing">Street food in Cape Town</h3>
        <p>There’s no better way to get to grips with progressive culinary treats, each steeped in the traditions of home cooking and local flavours, than gorging yourself at a street food market. To sample the finest local produce, and taste updates on South African classics like Boerewors rolls, check out the Old Biscuit Mill. An incredible revamp of one cool building, the regular market showcases artisan local produce and freshly cooked delights. Bay Harbour Market is a great alternative, with a plethora of treats and a good range of craft beer on tap. If you’re still feeling the itch to feast on more culinary treasures, head to City Bowl Market on Hope on a Thursday evening – another fine night of local produce, artfully cooked up, with local craft wine and beer and live music to boot. It makes for one excellent night out, Cape Town style!</p>

        <h3 class="title title--lower title--medium title--spacing">Eating out in Soweto</h3>
        <p>For a truly authentic township experience, let alone to sample some of the best eats around in the company of the most warm and welcoming people in the country, dining in Soweto makes for an unforgettable evening. For classic Soweto street food, stop off at Ntsitsi’s Fun Foods, a Soweto institution in the heart of Diepkloof which serves up Soweto-style kotas. Kota is a township version of bunny chow, made of a hollowed out loaf of bread packed with fries, Russian sausage, cold meat, mango atchar, sauces and cheese – often more. People travel far and wide for Ntsitsi’s. A better known food spot has to be  Sakhumzi’s. Set on the famous road that was home to both Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela, Sakhumzi serves up authentic township faves including tripe and lamb stew, and the place positively buzzes in the evenings. One final recommendation for township dining has to be the Jazz Maniacs restaurant at the Soweto Hotel and Conference Room. Prime time has to be the Sunday buffet barbeque, with live jazz band accompaniment out on the terrace.</p>

            <h3 class="title title--lower title--medium title--spacing">Durban Curry</h3>
            <p>A delicious symbol of South Africa’s diversity, the Durban Curry is a delectable homage to the large and historic Indian community of Durban. It’s the kind of dish that has permeated South African culture, being a home favourite of many locals. Another traditional way to serve this favourite curry is in a hollowed out loaf of bread, giving it the name Bunny Chow. Enjoy!</p>

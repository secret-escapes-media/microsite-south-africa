          <h3 class="title title--lg vpad-top--xs">Table Mountain</h3>
          <p>The iconic symbol of Cape Town, this remarkable flat topped mountain is an awe-inspiring sight. Framing the city at every angle, it permeates the downtown landscape. It’s potentially this defiant presence in the mindframe of locals that stirs up such adoration for this natural wonder. It inspires the same journey in all who see it; you must conquer its steep slopes and stand on top of that inviting flat top. Whether you choose to hike, or take the cable car, you’ll be rewarded with breathtaking views. This really should be on your bucket list.</p>

          <h3 class="title title--lg vpad-top--xs">Blyde River Canyon</h3>
          <p>This is quite possibly the most stunning thing you’ll see in South Africa. It truly is a sublime sight. This river canyon, the third largest in the world, embodies a drama that, as you reach one of many viewing points, will leave you breathless. Most visitors will drive from point to point, but it deserves exploring on foot. It has an incredibly diverse ecosystem, and offers the chance of sighting the rare Taita falcon. With dramatic formations like the ‘Chief and his Three Wives’, some of the countries most incredible waterfalls, and the vast Drakensberg mountain range looming over, Blyde is an unforgettable stop.</p>

          <h3 class="title title--sm vpad-top--xs">Camps Bay</h3>
          <p>If you’re hanging out in Cape Town and fancy a day soaking up the rays and having a dip, then you’d be a fool to miss Camps Bay. A touch further down the coast than Clifton’s beaches, Camps Bay is nestled on the other side of the Table Mountain Reserve, making for a slightly more secluded feel that works at a slower pace to central Cape Town. With a host of great bars and restaurants to check out, the beach is framed dramatically by the Twelve Apostles, the jutting peaks around Table Mountain.</p>

          <h3 class="title title--sm vpad-top--xs">Coffee Bay</h3>
          <p>On the Eastern Cape, this isolated spot is idyllic in droves. Coffee Bay is lapped by the balmy Indian Ocean, against a small cove that exemplifies beach paradise. Wind through the Xhosa Rondavels to this secluded beach, nestled between two majestic cliffs. Dive during the Sardine Run, or swim with dolphins. </p>

          <h3 class="title title--sm vpad-top--xs">Golden Mile, Durban</h3>
          <p>There’s no chance of missing this golden coastline if you’re staying in Durban. This is premiere beach perfect for sunbathing, surfing and dipping in the warm Indian Ocean. Long stretches of soft sand offer plenty of room for beach frolics, and with a host of shops and bars at hand, it’s easy to spend days on end whiling away the hours in the sun. Be sure to check out the different artists and their beach sculptures, offering a string of mini galleries on this Golden Mile.</p>

        <h3 class="title title--lg vpad-top--xs">Kruger National Park</h3>
        <div class="row row--6-6-gutters">
          <div class="col">
            <p>Kruger is a veritable haven of diverse wilderness that is equal parts wild and accessible. It is one of the richest places on earth for catching roaming animals in vast density and range – you’ll be sure to find a range of wildlife, from lion, leopard, hippo and cheetah, to rhino, giraffe and elephant. There’s a vast choice of accommodation (some of which is just breathtaking) plus plenty of guided tours – a real bonus being that both are generally very reasonably priced. Spread over nearly 20,000 sq km, there’s a vast expanse to untap – from the tropical forests that cut through the north, to the Lebombo Mountains that rise out of the east. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            <p>In the southern parts you can expect high-end stays that will leave you speechless – from haute cuisine to stunning design. The northern parts of the park, where the jungles take over, offer a very different experience. Here you can immerse yourself in this dense wonderland, with over 500 species of birds squawking in the depths of the canopy. The accommodation becomes a little more basic for a true, adventurer’s safari. It also begins to unpick the narrative of Kruger – a spellbinding expanse full of diversity and riches.</p>

          <h3 class="title title--md vpad-top--xs">The Big Five</h3>
          <p>The Big Five has become a moniker synonymous with the safari. It actually originated among hunters, as a catch-all term to describe the most difficult animals to track and hunt on foot. A rather morbid beginning for a term that now celebrates witnessing these majestic animals in their natural habitat.</p>

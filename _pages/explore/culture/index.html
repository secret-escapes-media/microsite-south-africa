          <h3 class="title title--md vpad-top--xs">Cradle of Humankind</h3>
          <p>The Cradle of Humankind is quite possible one of the most fascinating places in South Africa, for its unique universal appeal. It champions the ‘Out of Africa’ theory, which maintains that all human beings can be traced back to, you guessed it, Africa. The Cradle of Humankind is one of the most important palaeontological sites in the world, with a subterranean network of limestone caves which have relinquished a host of pre-human fossils. It is one of eight World Heritage Sites in South Africa. Explore the Sterkfontein Caves, Swartkrans and Kromdraai, among plenty other sites.</p>
          <p>Enter the Maropeng Visitor’s Centre at the heart of the area, for exhibitions and displays that unravel the story of these ancient fossils. Take a tour of the Sterkfontein caves, where over 500 Hominid fossils have been found alone. The Cradle of Humankind is, as the name suggests, a pivotal region for the exploration of modern human’s ancestral history. It’s a captivating experience that has been sympathetically carved out to illuminate this awe-inspiring history.</p>

            <h3 class="title title--xs vpad-top--xs">San Rock Art</h3>
            <p>The San, or Bushmen, are an indigenous people of southern Africa, in particular South Africa. Their ancestors left a legacy of rock art, lauded as some of the most complex and sophisticated in the world. A permanent exhibition is open in the Drakensberg mountains, and the Iziko SA museum in Cape Town also has an exhibit, even featuring entire cave walls that have been relocated.</p>

            <p>If you want first hand experience of Zulu culture, look no further than this immersive experience. Shakaland is an exploratory review of all facets of this dynamic people. At this recreation of a traditional Zulu homestead you’ll participate in a ceremony, be shown Zulu customs, and even try the beer – and, of course, the famous Zulu dance. </p>

          <div class="bg-img bg-img--3-2" style="background-image: url('{{site.baseurl}}/img/content/culture/townships.jpg'); background-position: center bottom;"></div>
          <h3 class="title title--md vpad-top--xs">Townships</h3>
          <p>Townships are an inescapable reality of pre and post apartheid life. Initially, these cheaply built houses were designated as men’s dormitories for black-only workers moving from the country to the new factories in the city. Wives and children were only admitted later on in their history. As ever with these temporary spaces, and particularly in segregated South Africa, the townships remained, often without clean water, electricity or proper sanitation. The stark contrast between these slum dwellings and the uptown areas narrate the harsh inequality of South Africa during apartheid. This is most symbolically played out in the visual cue of the Soweto power station, where power was generated for wealthy citizens in the heart of a township with no such commodity.</p>
          <p>Aside from the grim reality of the townships’ existence, they are also characterised by a rather special vivacity and joy that has come to typify the South African working class. The strength of these communities is famous, and has been the pivotal holding point during the decisive years that finally ended apartheid. Today, the shacks and pre-fabs are slowly being replaced by more permanent structures, with electricity and clean water, while the roads are tarmacked over. The townships, an ideological battleground of state-enforced subjugation, have risen from their intended fragility and become a beacon of the rainbow nation.</p>

            <h3 class="title title--xs vpad-top--xs">Robben Island</h3>
            <p>This island prison was first used by the VOC (Dutch East India Company), and wasn’t closed until 1996. Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it stands to commemorate those wrongfully imprisoned during apartheid – in particular it’s most famous resident, Nelson Mandela.</p>

            <h3 class="title title--xs vpad-top--xs">District Six Museum</h3>
            <p>This museum illustrates a particularly emotive example of life during apartheid. District Six was a flourishing area near the port, where freed slaves mixed with Malay, Indian and Afrikaan people. This threatened the apartheid philosophy of the government, and the district was bulldozed. The museum pays tribute to the flourishing community, whilst exploring the apartheid regime.</p>

          <h3 class="title title--md vpad-top--xs">Jazz</h3>
          <p>Jazz in South Africa permeates the cultural tapestry and makeup of the rainbow nation. It was a vehicle of expression, an expression which quickly became inextricably linked to repression during apartheid. It symbolises the conversation of ordinary South Africans with the rest of the world, and puts melodies to the cries of the people. It’s specific to the plight of many South Africans, yet universal in its optimism and beauty – this is well illustrated in its spanning influences. Cape Jazz in particular is a fevered mix of Khoisan and Cape minstrel vernacular music, American jazz, Afro-Brazilian rhythms, and influences from Europe and Asia. This universal conversation allowed for South African jazz to lift people’s spirits out of the local. With many artists having fled apartheid, they brought distinctly South African messages, those that had resonated in the townships, to a global platform.</p>
          <p>This is best illustrated by Abdullah Ibrahim’s seminal work, Mannenberg. It quickly became the anthem for the lingering misery of the displaced District Six community, and for all townships across the country. It is sombre as it is uplifting, and is a spirited adventure that delves deep into the heart of the resounding resilience of the rainbow nation.</p>
          <p>Jazz is escapism, and jazz is joy; go to any jazz club and see locals twist and shake with an electricity that’s hard to beat. Cape Jazz Tours are a great way to learn more, giving you the chance to meet musicians, and here plenty of improvs. Failing that, the highlight has to be Cape Town International Jazz Festival. Don’t miss this intrinsic and dynamic part of South African culture.</p>

            <h3 class="title title--xs vpad-top--xs">Arts on Main</h3>
            <p>This multi-discipline arts centre is a flourishing creative hub in Jo’burg. Having taken over a dilapidated warehouse, the centre encompasses studio space, galleries, selected retail and restaurants. It’s a much loved pillar of Maboneng precinct, with plenty of performances to go and check out – plus a great Sunday market to boot!</p>

            <p>This is Cape Town’s very own creative centre, once again housed in an old warehouse building. Packed with creative space, from studios to retail space, Woodstock Exchange is a platform for up and coming designers and crafters to showcase their designs, and for locals and visitors to invest in the future of Cape Town’s creative outlet.</p>

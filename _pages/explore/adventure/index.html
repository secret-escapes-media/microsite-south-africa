          <p>There’s no shortage of opportunity for jumping off great heights and hoping that the elastic band stopping you from falling to the ground is attached at both ends.

Bungee between the iconic Soweto Orlando Towers, or tackle the highest commercial bridge bungee in the world, Bloukrans Bridge in the Eastern Cape – the choice is yours, but one thing is guaranteed, a rush of fear and adrenaline like no other!</p>

  <h2>Go where the wild things are</h2>
  <p>Few places in the world offer travellers as much diversity as South Africa. Lashed by the Atlantic on the West and lapped by the warm Indian Ocean on the East, this extraordinary country is probably the hardest destination to pack for – but it’s worth the challenge. Take in the roaming Big Five in Kruger, the stacked wine barrels of Stellenbosch, the penguin-inhabited shore on the Western Cape and the views over Cape Town from the mighty Table Mountain. The more time you have to visit, the better.</p>
